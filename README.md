# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project
We must complete additional analysis on data set including numbers and reports on:
* Analysis of scores ommitting Thomas High School
* Complete the school district analysis once more with ommitted scores

### Purpose
To analyze reading and math scores for a public school district. 

## Results Summary

### Analysis of Scores on Standardized Tests
Removing students from the database was expected to affect overall passing scores

### Results 
* Affect on district summary: Removing the 461 9th Graders from Thomas High School lowered the percentage of overall passing students as shown below in the district summary with THS grades (top) and without (bottom)

* Affect on school summary: Scores for THS were lower in the school summary
* Affect on replacing 9th grade scores: THS showed lower passing rates when 9th grade scores were removed from the data set
* Affect on math and reading scores by grade:
* Scores by school spending: modest changes were seen in the $630-644 spending range; decrease in scores were seen when removing THS as seen in data set with THS (top) and without (bottom)

* Scores by school size: There was no change in percent passing based on school size - very negligible change were seen in the "medium school size" bin, which is THS's bin.
* Scores by school type: There was little effect on scores by school type; there was a slight decrease in scores when THS was removed from the data set as shown by scores with THS (top) and without THS (bottom)
